Mathematical Documentation (Theory)
***********************************

In this Section the **mathematical description** of the model will be
explained. The structure here follows the basic code structure and proceeds as
follows:
First, a short introduction into the type of optimization problem solvable with
urbs is given. This is followed by the description of the minimal possible
model in urbs. As a next step the two main expansions of models, which also
increase the index depth of all variables and parameters are discussed in the
parts 'Intertemporal modeling' and 'multinode modeling'. The description is
then concluded by the additional description of various feature modules.
